### Issues

* See open issues on GitHub issues

## Requirements

### Provider Use

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11.11+
* [Nutanix](https://portal.nutanix.com/#/page/home) Prism Central 5.6.0+
* Note: Nutanix Community Edition will be supported, when an AOS 5.6 based version is released

### Provider Development

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11+ (to build the provider plugin)

### Provider Use

The Terraform Nutanix provider is designed to work with Nutanix Prism Central, such that you can manage one or more Prism Element clusters at scale. AOS/PC 5.6.0 or higher is required, as this Provider makes exclusive use of the v3 APIs

## Example Usage

See the Examples folder for a handful of main.tf demos as well as some pre-compiled binaries.

We'll be refreshing these examples and binaries as we work through tech preview.

Long term, once this is upstream, no pre-compiled binaries will be needed, as terraform will automatically download on use.

## Configuration Reference

The following keys can be used to configure the provider.

* **endpoint** - (Required) IP address for the Nutanix Prism Element.
* **username** - (Required) Username for Nutanix Prism Element. Could be local cluster auth (e.g. `auth`) or directory auth.
* **password** - (Required) Password for the provided username.
* **port** - (Optional) Port for the Nutanix Prism Element. Default port is 9440.
* **insecure** - (Optional) Explicitly allow the provider to perform insecure SSL requests. If omitted, default value is false.

## Roadmap

This provider will be released as Tech Preview at .NEXT New Orleans, and is linked into the HashiCorp community providers page, here: [](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/type/community-index.html)

We'll be working with HashiCorp as code stabilizes to upstream this properly, at which time we'll PR this entire plugin to the terraform providers org.

* Complete upstream work with successful pull request
  * Note: Depending on external review timelines from HashiCorp and subsequent code change(s) as required
* Add Volume Group resource and data source support \* This is dependent on the VG v3 API, which is currently not GA (work in progress)
* Investigate data protection workflows (likely scoped snapshots, but this may directly conflict with overall pets v cattle)
* Investigate project as a resource and data source, for SSP integration
* Investigate Calm once API constructs are available
* Investigate AFS administration workflows
* Investigate cluster administration APIs (think foundation, admin settings, etc) to do physical provisioning (think DC as Code)

## Quick Install

### Install Dependencies

* Terraform

### For developing or build from source

#### Golang

[](https://github.com/golang/go)

#### Dep: Go dependency management tool

On MacOS you can install or upgrade to the latest released version with Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew install dep
$ brew upgrade dep
```

On other platforms you can use the `install.sh` script:

```sh
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
```

It will install into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory by default or any other directory you specify using the `INSTALL_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

If your platform is not supported, you'll need to build it manually or let the team (go/dep team) know and we'll consider adding your platform
to the release builds.

More Info: https://github.com/golang/dep

## Install from source

## Building from sources

1. Follow [Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)

2. Make sure that `$GOPATH` variable is set (and `$GOROOT` if necessary)

3. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix
    ```

4. Install [golang/dep](https://github.com/golang/dep):

    ```bash
    go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
    ```

5. Get dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix
    dep ensure
    ```

6. Run tests:

    ```bash
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix
    make test #unit tests
    make testacc #acceptance tests
    ```

7. Build the binary:

    ```bash
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix
    make cibuild #it will create a pkg folder with the binaries for all OS including linux, windows, macOS
    ```

## Release it

1. Install `goreleaser` tool:

    ```bash
    go get -v github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser
    go install
    ```

    Alternatively you can download a latest release from [goreleaser Releases Page](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases)

1. Clean up folder `(builds)` if exists

1. Make sure that the repository state is clean:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

1. Tag the release:

    ```bash
    git tag v1.1.0
    ```

1. Run `goreleaser`:

    ```bash
    cd (TODO: go dir)
    goreleaser --skip-publish v1.1.0
    ```

1. Check builds inside `(TODO: build dir)` directory.

1. Publish release tag to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin v1.1.0
    ```

## Install from package

## Building/Developing Provider

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix`

```sh
$ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers && cd "$_" #if you already created it only change directory
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
$
>>>>>>> chore: fix bad urls in readme.md file
$ git clone https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix.git
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix
$ make deps
$ make build
```

This will create a binary file `terraform-provider-nutanix` you can copy to your terraform specific project.

Alternative build: with our demo

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nutanix
$ make deps
$ go build -o examples/terraform-provider-nutanix
$ cd examples
$ terraform init #to try out our demo
```
