# nutanix_category_v2
Fetch a category


## Example

```hcl

resource "nutanix_category_v2" "example" {
  key         = "category_example_key"
  value       = "category_example_value"
  description = "category example description"
}

```


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `key`: -(Required) The key of a category when it is represented in key:value format. Constraints applicable when field is given in the payload during create and update:

  - A string of maxlength of 64
  - Character at the start cannot be `$`
  - Character `/` is not allowed anywhere.

  It is a mandatory field in the payload of `createCategory` and `updateCategoryById` APIs.
  This field can't be updated through `updateCategoryById` API.
* `value`: -(Required) The value of a category when it is represented in key:value format.  Constraints applicable when field is given in the payload during create and update:

  - A string of maxlength of 64
  - Character at the start cannot be `$`
  - Character `/` is not allowed anywhere.

  It is a mandatory field in the payload of `createCategory` and `updateCategoryById` APIs.
  This field can't be updated through `updateCategoryById` API.
  Updating the value will not change the extId of the category.
* `type`: -(Required) Denotes the type of a category.
    Valid values are:
     - `SYSTEM` Predefined categories contained in the system to be used by workflows visible in the UI that involve categories. System-defined categories can't be created through the Categories API. They are predefined in a configuration file and are created at PC boot-up time. System-defined categories can't be updated or deleted.
     - `INTERNAL` Predefined categories contained in the system to be used by internal services, APIs and workflows that involve categories. These categories will not be visible in the UI. However, these categories will be returned in the response of `listCategories` and `getCategoryById` APIs, and are available for filtering as well. Internal categories can't be created through the Categories API. They are predefined in a configuration file and are created at PC boot-up time. Internal categories can't be updated or deleted.
     - `USER` These categories get created by users through the invocation of `createCategory` API. User-defined categories can be updated or deleted after creation.

* `description`: -(Optional) A string consisting of the description of the category as defined by the user.
Description can be optionally provided in the payload of createCategory and updateCategoryById APIs.
Description field can be updated through updateCategoryById API.
The server does not validate this value nor does it enforce the uniqueness or any other constraints.
It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that any semantic or syntactic constraints are retained when mutating this field.

* `owner_uuid`: -(Optional) This field contains the UUID of a user who owns the category.
This field will be ignored if given in the payload of createCategory API. Hence, when a category is created, the logged-in user automatically becomes the owner of the category.
This field can be updated through updateCategoryById API, in which case, should be provided, UUID of a valid user is present in the system.
Validity of the user UUID can be checked by invoking the API: authn/users/{extId} in the 'Identity and Access Management' or 'IAM' namespace.
It is used for enabling RBAC access to self-owned categories.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `key`: The key of a category when it is represented in key:value format.
* `value`: The value of a category when it is represented in key:value format
* `type`: Denotes the type of category.
There are three types of categories: SYSTEM, INTERNAL, and USER.
* `description`: A string consisting of the description of the category as defined by the user.
* `owner_uuid`: This field contains the UUID of a user who owns the category.
* `associations`: This field gives basic information about resources that are associated with the category.
The results present under this field summarize the counts of various kinds of resources associated with the category.
For more detailed information about the UUIDs of the resources, please look into the field detailedAssociations.
This field will be ignored, if given in the payload of updateCategoryById or createCategory APIs.
This field will not be present by default in listCategories API, unless the parameter $expand=associations is present in the URL.
* `detailed_associations`: This field gives detailed information about the resources which are associated with the category.
The results present under this field contain the UUIDs of the entities and policies of various kinds associated with the category.
This field will be ignored, if given in the payload of updateCategoryById or createCategory APIs.
This field will not be present by default in listCategories or getCategoryById APIs, unless the parameter $expand=detailedAssociations is present in the URL.
* `tenant_id`: A globally unique identifier that represents the tenant that owns this entity.
