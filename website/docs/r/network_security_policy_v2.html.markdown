Create a Network Security Policy

## Example

```hcl

# Network Security Policy TWO_ENV_ISOLATION Rule
resource "nutanix_network_security_policy_v2" "isolation-nsp" {
  name        = "isolation_policy"
  description = "isolation policy example"
  state       = "SAVE"
  type        = "ISOLATION"
  rules {
    type = "TWO_ENV_ISOLATION"
    spec {
      two_env_isolation_rule_spec {
        first_isolation_group = ["ba250e3e-1db1-4950-917f-a9e2ea35b8e3"]
        second_isolation_group = ["ab520e1d-4950-1db1-917f-a9e2ea35b8e3"]
      }
    }
  }
  is_hitlog_enabled = true
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name`: (Required) Name of the Flow Network Security Policy.
- `type`: (Required) Defines the type of rules that can be used in a policy. Acceptable values are "QUARANTINE", "ISOLATION", "APPLICATION".
- `description`: (Optional) A user defined annotation for a policy.
- `state`: (Optional) Whether the policy is applied or monitored; can be omitted or set null to save the policy without applying or monitoring it. Acceptable values are "SAVE", "MONITOR", "ENFORCE".
- `rules`: (Optional) A list of rules that form a policy. For isolation policies, use isolation rules; for application or quarantine policies, use application rules.

- `is_hitlog_enabled`: (Optional) If Hitlog is enabled.
- `scope`: Defines the scope of the policy. Currently, only ALL_VLAN and VPC_LIST are supported. If scope is not provided, the default is set based on whether vpcReferences field is provided or not.
- `vpc_reference`: (Optional) A list of external ids for VPCs, used only when the scope of policy is a list of VPCs.

### rules

- `description`: (Optional) A user defined annotation for a rule.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:
