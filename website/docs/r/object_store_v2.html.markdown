# nutanix_object_store_v2

Run the prechecks, create and start the deployment of an Object store on Prism Central.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Before deleting the Object Store, make sure to delete all buckets inside it manually.
> Currently, the Terraform provider does not support the Delete Bucket API.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The Object Store **update** operation is intended **only** to resume a failed deployment.
> It should be used when the Object Store is in the `OBJECT_STORE_DEPLOYMENT_FAILED` state.
> Triggering an update in this state will attempt to resume the deployment process.
