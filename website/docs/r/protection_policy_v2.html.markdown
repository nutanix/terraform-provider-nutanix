# nutanix_protection_policy_v2

Creates a protection policy to automate the recovery point creation and replication process.



## Example—Synchronous Protection Policy

```hcl

resource "nutanix_protection_policy_v2" "synchronous-protection-policy"{
  name        = "synchronous_protection_policy"

  replication_configurations {
    source_location_label = "source"
    remote_location_label = "target"
    schedule {
      recovery_point_objective_time_seconds         = 0
      recovery_point_type                           = "CRASH_CONSISTENT"
      sync_replication_auto_suspend_timeout_seconds = 10
    }
  }
  replication_configurations {
    source_location_label = "target"

##### Cluster Ext Ids
The cluster_ext_ids attribute supports the following:

All clusters are considered if the cluster external identifier list is empty.

### Replication Configurations
The replication_configurations attribute supports the following:

* `remote_location_label`: -(Optional) Label of the source location from the replication locations list, where the entity will be replicated.
* `schedule`: -(Required) Schedule for protection. The schedule specifies the recovery point objective and the retention policy for the participating locations.

#### Schedule
The schedule attribute supports the following:

* `recovery_point_type`: -(Optional) Type of recovery point.
    * `CRASH_CONSISTENT`: Crash-consistent Recovery points capture all the VM and application level details.
    * `APP_CONSISTENT`: Application-consistent Recovery points can capture all the data stored in the memory and also the in-progress transaction details.
* `recovery_point_objective_time_seconds`: -(Required) The Recovery point objective of the schedule in seconds and specified in multiple of 60 seconds. Only following RPO values can be provided for rollup retention type:
    - Minute(s): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15
    - Hour(s): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12

    - Week(s): 1, 2
* `retention`: -(Optional) Specifies the retention policy for the recovery point schedule.
* `start_time`: -(Optional) Represents the protection start time for the new entities added to the policy after the policy is created in h:m format. The values must be between 00h:00m and 23h:59m and in UTC timezone. It specifies the time when the first snapshot is taken and replicated for any entity added to the policy. If this is not specified, the snapshot is taken immediately and replicated for any new entity added to the policy.
* `sync_replication_auto_suspend_timeout_seconds`: -(Optional) Auto suspend timeout if there is a connection failure between locations for synchronous replication. If this value is not set, then the policy will not be suspended.

#### Retention
> One of `linear_retention` or `auto_rollup_retention` must be specified.

* `linear_retention`: -(Optional) Linear retention policy.
* `auto_rollup_retention`: -(Optional) Auto rollup retention policy.

##### Linear Retention
The linear_retention attribute supports the following:

* `local`: -(Required) Specifies the number of recovery points to retain on the local location.
* `remote`: -(Optional) Specifies the number of recovery points to retain on the remote location.

##### Auto Rollup Retention
The auto_rollup_retention attribute supports the following:

* `local`: -(Required) Specifies the auto rollup retention details.
* `remote`: -(Optional) Specifies the auto rollup retention details.

###### Local, Remote
The local, remote attribute in the auto_rollup_retention supports the following:

* `snapshot_interval_type`: -(Required) Snapshot interval period.
    * `YEARLY`: Specifies the number of latest yearly recovery points to retain.
    * `WEEKLY`: Specifies the number of latest weekly recovery points to retain.
    * `DAILY`: Specifies the number of latest daily recovery points to retain.
    * `MONTHLY`: Specifies the number of latest monthly recovery points to retain.
    * `HOURLY`: Specifies the number of latest hourly recovery points to retain.
* `frequency`: -(Required) Multiplier to 'snapshotIntervalType'. For example, if 'snapshotIntervalType' is 'YEARLY' and 'multiple' is 5, then 5 years worth of rollup snapshots will be retained.
