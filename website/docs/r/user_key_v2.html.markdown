## Import

This helps to manage existing entities which are not created through terraform. User Key can be imported using the `user ExtID/keyExtID`. (ext_id in v4 API context). eg,

**Note**:To import User Key, you need to have the User Key UUID, and provide it in the format mentioned above while importing.

```hcl
// create its configuration in the root module. For example:
resource "nutanix_user_key_v2" "import_uk"{}

// execute the below command. UUID can be fetched using datasource. Example:

// list users
data "nutanix_users_v2" "fetch_users"{}

// list keys for a user
data "nutanix_user_keys_v2" "fetch_uks"{
    user_ext_id = data.nutanix_users_v2.fetch_users.users[0].ext_id
}

terraform import nutanix_user_key_v2.import_uk userExtID/keyExtID
```
