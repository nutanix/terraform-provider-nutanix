## Import

This helps to manage existing entities which are not created through terraform. Users can be imported using the `UUID`.  eg,
```hcl
// create its configuration in the root module. For example:
resource "nutanix_users_v2" "import_user" {}

// execute this command
terraform import nutanix_users_v2.import_user <UUID>
```

## Delete Behavior

Deleting users via Terraform is **not currently supported** in `nutanix_users_v2`.
If you attempt to delete a resource, Terraform will issue a **warning** and continue without removing the actual user in Prism Central.

To delete a user, you must remove it manually via the **Prism Central UI**, or as a workaround, you can:

1. **Import the user into the `nutanix_user` resource** (v3 API).
2. Use Terraform to delete the user, as delete operations are supported in the v3 API.
